2.Cinema Booking System  
Create a system for cinema booking with MySQL.  
This system has information about films, clients, bookings infomation, screening and rooms info of the cinema.

3.Mobile Sales System  
Create a system for mobile sales with MySQL.  
This inspiration comes from the 2022 Black Friday Costco Smartphone Deals.  
The lineup on Black Friday is usually long!  
Therefore, there is a virtual line-up so you can make reservation to put yourself in line.  
This system has information about phones, customers, reservations, stores, plans, telecom_company and sales_order.  
Through the system we can create views, stored procedures, functions and triggers to search and retrieve all information about the mobile sales.
